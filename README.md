# Pizzabot

The assignment is about using JavaScript to make an order in a mock-online-pizzeria. The customer should be able to order a meal and specify it. The customer will also be able to order for a child or adult and finaly confirm their order.

I followed the provided instructions and tried to search for clean code practices.
